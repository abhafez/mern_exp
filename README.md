### In this App

#### Absolute paths in REACT APP are used

**please check the front-end code in a separate window**
`cd client && code .`

#### Technologies

- Node - Express - Mongodb to handle back-end
- ReactJS for front-end (React Hooks)
- Jest for testing
- Semantic-UI for better look (sorry for the black color)
- Styled components

### Testing

use npm scripts to test

- server side `npm run test`
- clinet side `npm run test:client`

### Notes

- This is my first time to write seeds and backend (more than a simple tutorial from time to time) I don't know best practice. Your advice is appreciated.
- I created the useRequest custom hook. it's not the best, I know, but I didn't try other solutions soon.
- The pagination component is mine too. It's limited but it works
